## âœ… Fixed: TooltipProvider useState Error

**Error:**

**Cause:**
This occurred because the `TooltipProvider` was incorrectly implemented or used outside the valid React tree.

**Fix:**
Refactored `TooltipProvider` to ensure it is a proper functional component and all React hooks are used correctly within valid scope.
